Fire Detection Model Using YOLOv8
Introduction

This project is a fire detection model built using YOLOv8. It identifies fire in images and videos, providing a robust solution for early fire detection.
Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, containing labeled images of fire and non-fire scenarios.
