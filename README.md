# Fire Detection Model Using YOLOv8

## Overview
This project involves building a fire detection model using the YOLOv8 architecture. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle to detect fire in images and videos. The primary goal is to achieve accurate and efficient fire detection to assist in safety and surveillance applications.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Classes**: Fire and Non-Fire
- **Structure**:
  - Training set
  - Validation set
  - Test set

## Model Architecture
The project leverages the YOLOv8 architecture, known for its:
- High speed and accuracy.
- Advanced feature detection.
- Scalability for various hardware setups.

## Results
- **Metrics**: Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5
- **Visualization**: Detected fire regions are highlighted in bounding boxes.

## Applications
- Fire safety systems
- Surveillance in high-risk areas
- Early warning systems for disaster management

## Future Work
- Enhance the dataset with more diverse fire scenarios.
- Optimize the model for real-time deployment.
